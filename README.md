# fb-frontend

This is the React front-end for the Facebook Marketplace.

## Motivation
<!-- A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists. -->

Wanting to learn more about React and to build a bigger application, I built 
the front end portion for the back end application that I designed in Express.

[(Backend Application)](https://github.com/JuanLee10/fb-backend). 

<!-- ## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. -

## Tech/framework used

### Built with
<b>Frontend:</b>
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)
- [Node Sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)
- [JSON Web Token](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

## Features
The application allows users to sign up and log into their accounts to 
post their own listings as well as find other listings based on filters,
and location. The user can apply for various listings which makes an AJAX 
request to our API and makes the corresponding change in the front-end. 
Various routes to the application are protected through a middleware ensuring 
that only logged in user can view those pages.

## Future directions


<!-- 

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.
